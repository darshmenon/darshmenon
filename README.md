# 👋 Hi, I'm Darsh Menon

🎓 Robotics Enthusiast | 🦾 Building Autonomous Systems

I'm currently building an **autonomous pick-and-place system** using:
- 🧠 ROS 2 Jazzy
- 🤖 UR5 Robot + Robotiq 2F-85 Gripper
- 🏗️ Gazebo Harmonic + MoveIt 2
- 👁️ Vision-based control + Point Cloud Processing

🔍 I’m interested in:
- Motion planning (OMPL, Cartesian)
- Autonomous task sequencing (MoveIt Task Constructor)
- AI-driven robotics and robot perception
